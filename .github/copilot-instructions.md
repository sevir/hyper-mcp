# hyper-mcp

## Project Overview

A fast, secure MCP server that extends its capabilities through WebAssembly plugins

## Technology Stack

- **Language**: Rust
- **Framework**: Rust
- **Database**: none

## Steps for doing tasks

- Use always english language for documenting and coding. Is possible that you have part of the task in other language, but the final result must be in english.
- Check with Context7 the documentation for any specific guidelines.
- Ask for help if you are stuck.
  
- Check always if serena is onboarding performed.
- Use Serena tools for search symbols, edit code or refactor.
  
  
- Search in the knowledge base for relevant information, use mcp_remembrances tools for listing facts, entities and relationships, and getting the most relevant ones and search documents and getting the most relevant ones, preferently.
- Use Remembrances tools always at the beginning of a task for searching any useful information and at the end for summarizing what you have learned.
- Saves into knowledge base documents all relevant information about the project changes of interest for the future tasks.
- Finally when the task is completed, use mcp_remembrances tools to save the relevant information for future tasks, in the knowledge base, facts, entities and relationships.
  
- If you have a complex task, break it down into smaller steps, use Sequential thinking and steps list for the process
- Fetch any relevant information from urls of the context task for updated context
- If you need build or running tests use Terminal tool or runCommand tool.
- Use the information found to complete the task.
- If you need to know from internet use mcp server web search tool, and fetch the most relevant information.
- Use prefently run_terminal tool to run commands, check code, and get the output.

## Development Guidelines

### Code Style

- Use Rust for all code
- Follow Rust conventions for server/client component separation
- Ensure consistent use of Rust features and idioms
- Always add tests for any new functionality.





### Deployment

- Run `cargo build` for building the project and review the output for any errors.
  

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- **Type Errors**: Check readonly props and proper Rust types

### Debug Tips

- Check terminal errors running tests or build
